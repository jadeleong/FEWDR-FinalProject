FEWDR Final Project

Final Project Proposal
My final project is redeveloping an existing website called Grow My Life (www.growmylife.com.au) for a live client.  

The website is the support/marketing side for interested parties to learn more about the Grow My Life app (still in development), and also download the app. 
The plan is in the future, the website will have additional content (with interactive elements) to support the GML app. 

I've recreated the 4 original pages (Landing, Practitioners, Enterprise, Contact) to include: 
- responsive design with a mobile first approach
- hamburger menu
- JS to clear the forms.
The forms currently have no actions as I'll have to speak to the GML team about what they want the form to do and how they want to capture the data.
