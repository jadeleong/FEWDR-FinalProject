FEWDR Final Project

Final Project Proposal
My final project is redeveloping a web "application" website called 'Grow My Life'.  The app is supporting people to achieve personal growth etc to achieve life satisfaction.  The website is the support/marketing side for the app (still being built), and also where they can "download" the app.  In the future, the website will also have additional content to support the life satisfaction goals - i.e. how to set goals, etc.
Anticipated pages are - Landing page (which might have lots of content vertically), and three other pages including a contact page. Hoping to also build in responsive design.
I'm also hoping to build in some interactivity on the user side (i.e., helping them to set their goals etc). But that might be a stretch goal... :)
